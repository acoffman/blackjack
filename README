This is a blackjack program that I wrote as part of the interview process for Rapleaf, a San Francisco based web startup. Rapleaf aggregates publically available information from the social web and delivers reports on their findings to companies that desire to offer a better, more targeted customer experience.

The program can be run at the command line with ruby blackjack.rb
Automated tests can be run at the command line with ruby spec_runner.rb
