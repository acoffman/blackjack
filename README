This is a blackjack program that I wrote as part of the interview process for Rapleaf, a San Francisco based web startup. Rapleaf aggregates publically available information from the social web.

The Blackjack Rules that this program enforces are fairly standard, and are the rules at the St. Louis area casinos.
	-Blackjacks pay 1.5:1
	-Blackjacks from a split do not count and pay 1:1
	-You can only double down for the same amount as your original bet, not more or less
	-You can only split cards that are of the same type (not the same value though, ie, you cannot split a queen and a jack)
	-Dealer must stand on hard 17, hit 16 and soft 17


The program can be run at the command line with 
 	ruby blackjack.rb

Automated tests can be run at the command line with
	ruby spec_runner.rb

I prefer the way that the spec_runner script delivers the output (although the same result could easily be produced with a rakefile)
But I appreciate the need for standardization, so I have also included a simple rakefile to run the RSpec tests as well.
	rake spec
